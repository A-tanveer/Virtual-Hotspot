        <h1 class="h">Share Internet Through Hotspot</h1>

        <p class="p ">
            1. Start Hotspot with your desired name and password from the application.<br>
            <br> 2. Go to "Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center ". You'll see a new Network has been created with your given name. Now click on the connection that you want to share with it. In my case it was "Ethernet 2".<br>
            <br> 3. Remember hotspots connection name, it will be needed later. in my case it was "Local Area Connection* 4".
        </p>

            4. Click Ethernet 2. Go to "Properties> Sharing". Now select "Alolw other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" (deselect if you want to stop sharing) and from the dropdown select your hotspots connection name. In my case
            it was "Local Area Connection* 4".

            The following procedure works for this issue.<br>
            <br>1. Disable your Internet Sharing and enable it again. See Steps 3, 4, 5 from left side of this page.
            <br><br>2. Disconnect from Internet and after a while connect again.
            <br> For the most cases this would solve the problem but if it doesn't continue following instructions.
            <br><br>3. open 'services.msc' from start > run > services.msc.

            Restart "Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)" service from the "services.msc" window.
        </p>
