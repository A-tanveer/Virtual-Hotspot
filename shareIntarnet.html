            1. Strat Hotspot with your desired name and password from the application<br>
            <br> 2. Go to "Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center ". You'll see a new Network has been created with your given name. Now click on the connection that you want to share with it. In my case it was Ethernet 2.<br>
            <br> 3. Remember the connection of your hotspots connection name.

            4. Go to "Properties> Sharing". Now select "Alolw other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" and from the dropdown select your hotspots connection name. In my case it was "Local Area Connection* 4".
